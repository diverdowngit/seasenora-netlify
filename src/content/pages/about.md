Hello We Are Fred, Sandra and Maya. We wanted to share our

experiences with others all across the world, so we started Sv Sea

Senora. to increase the rewards of well-known sites and the

accessibility of off-the-beaten-path locations.Both textual and visual storytelling are our passions. That's why we

made the decision to start a simple YouTube Site / travel blog.

passion for the sea with the world. Our channel is dedicated to

showcasing the joys of family sailing and providing helpful tips and

advice for families who are interested in getting started.

As a family of sailors, we understand the unique challenges and

rewards of sailing as a family. Our channel is a platform for us to

share our experiences and inspire other families to explore the world

of sailing together.
